## Serverless hosting: Vercel

<!--

Why Vercel? I evaluated from https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology#2-cloud-platforms

- AWS, Azure, Google Cloud are too complex for beginners
- Cloudflare (next most popular, widely admired) Python support is in beta
- Hetzner (most admired), Supabase (next most admired) do not have a serverless platform
- Fly.io (next most admired) does not have a free tier
- Heroku (used in previous terms) is the least admired
- Vercel is both popular, admired, growing, has a free plan, and a simple API

Serverless platforms let you rent a single function instead of an entire machine. They're perfect for small web tools that _don't need to run all the time_. Here are some common real-life uses:

- A contact form that emails you when someone wants to hire you (runs for 2-3 seconds, a few times per day)
- A tool that converts uploaded photos to black and white (runs for 5-10 seconds when someone uploads a photo)
- A chatbot that answers basic questions about your business hours (runs for 1-2 seconds per question)
- A newsletter sign-up that adds emails to your mailing list (runs for 1 second per sign-up)
- A webhook that posts your Etsy sales to Discord (runs for 1 second whenever you make a sale)

You only pay when someone uses your tool, and the platform automatically handles busy periods. For example, if 100 people fill out your contact form at once, the platform creates 100 temporary copies of your code to handle them all. When they're done, these copies disappear. It's cheaper than running a full-time server because you're not paying for the time when no one is using your tool - most tools are idle 95% of the time!
