**Q11: For the TDS project, do we have to choose the project, or will it be added to our course by default?**

**A11:** The TDS project is part of the course and will be automatically added. It's not a separate project like in other courses.

**Q12: Should I be worried that the evaluation scripts might be updated after I submit my answers, potentially changing my grade?**

**A12:** No, the evaluation scripts are updated to address additional corner cases, but the randomization of questions means that the changes are unlikely to affect your grade. The instructor suggests checking your answers again using GA2 as an exercise.

**Q13: How will we submit Project 1? Will it be via Google Form?**

**A13:** Yes, Project 1 will be submitted via Google Form. The deliverable will be a GitHub repository.

**Q14: I'm using Windows, but many questions require Ubuntu. I copied the downloaded files to my WSL home folder, but I'm not getting the correct answers. Is it possible to install a Windows system in Linux?**

**A14:** You can use WSL. The instructor asks for a screenshot to debug the issue. The student explains that they copied the files (a.txt and b.txt) to a TDS folder in their Ubuntu WSL environment. The `diff` command shows 40 lines of difference, but the submission is not accepted. The instructor suggests posting this on the Discourse forum.

**Q15: Question 16 in GA1 (rename files) is not accepting my answer, even though I've tried using ChatGPT. What's wrong?**

**A15:** The instructor suggests posting this on the Discourse forum with your email ID. The instructor notes that many submissions are randomized, so the issue may be related to the specific randomized version of the question.
