- [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) - a fast in-memory database that's very good with large-scale analysis
- [Plotly Datasets](https://github.com/plotly/datasets/) - a collection of sample datasets for analysis. This includes the [Kaggle Flights Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays) that the notebook downloads as [2015_flights.parquet](https://github.com/plotly/datasets/raw/master/2015_flights.parquet)
