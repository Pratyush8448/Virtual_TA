## LLM Text Extraction

[JSON](json.md) is one of the most widely used formats in the world for applications to exchange data.

This video explains how to use LLMs to extract structure from unstructured data, covering:

- **LLM for Data Extraction**: Use OpenAI's API to extract structured information from unstructured data like addresses.
- **JSON Schema**: Define a JSON schema to ensure consistent and structured output from the LLM.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Craft effective prompts to guide the LLM's response and improve accuracy.
- **Data Cleaning**: Use string functions and OpenAI's API to clean and standardize data.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze extracted data using Pandas to gain insights.
- **LLM Limitations**: Understand the limitations of LLMs, including potential errors and inconsistencies in output.
- **Production Use Cases**: Explore real-world applications of LLMs for data extraction, such as customer service email analysis.

Structured Outputs is a feature that ensures the model will always generate responses that adhere to your supplied
[JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/overview/what-is-jsonschema), so you don't need to worry about the model omitting a required key,
or hallucinating an invalid enum value.
