-- Export results
   .headers on
   .mode csv
   .output results.csv
   SELECT * FROM table;
   ```

2. **Performance Optimization**

   ```sql
   -- Create index
   CREATE INDEX idx_user_email ON users(email);

   -- Analyze query
   EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE email LIKE '%@example.com';

   -- Show indexes
   SELECT * FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='index';
   ```

3. **Data Analysis**

   ```sql
   -- Time series aggregation
   SELECT
       date(timestamp),
       COUNT(*) as events,
       AVG(duration) as avg_duration
   FROM events
   GROUP BY date(timestamp);

   -- Window functions
   SELECT *,
       AVG(amount) OVER (
           PARTITION BY user_id
           ORDER BY date
           ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
       ) as moving_avg
   FROM transactions;
   ```
