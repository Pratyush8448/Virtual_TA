## Parsing JSON

JSON is everywhere—APIs, logs, configuration files—and its nested or large structure can challenge memory and processing. In this tutorial, we'll explore tools to flatten, stream, and query JSON data efficiently.

For example, we'll often need to process a multi-gigabyte log file from a web service where each record is a JSON object.

This requires us to handle complex nested structures, large files that don't fit in memory, or extract specific fields. Here are the key tools and techniques for efficient JSON parsing:

| Tool                                        | Extract from JSON...   | Why                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [jq](#command-line-json-processing-with-jq) | JSON in the shell      | Quick data exploration and pipeline processing                    |
| [JMESPath](#jmespath-queries)               | JSON in Python         | Handle complex queries with a clean syntax                        |
| [ijson](#streaming-with-ijson)              | JSON streams in Python | Parse streaming/large JSON files memory-efficiently               |
| [Pandas](#pandas-json-columns)              | JSON columns in Python | Fast analysis of structured data                                  |
| [SQL JSON](#sql-json-functions)             | JSON in databases      | Combine structured and semi-structured data                       |
| [DuckDB](#duckdb-json-processing)           | JSON anywhere          | Fast analysis of JSON files / databases without loading to memory |

**Examples:**

- Use Pandas when you need to transform API responses into a DataFrame for further analysis.
- Leverage ijson when dealing with huge JSON logs where memory is at a premium.
- Apply jq for quick, iterative exploration directly in your terminal.

### Command-line JSON Processing with jq

[jq](https://jqlang.org/) is a versatile command-line tool for slicing, filtering, and transforming JSON. It excels in quick data exploration and can be integrated into shell scripts for automated data pipelines.
