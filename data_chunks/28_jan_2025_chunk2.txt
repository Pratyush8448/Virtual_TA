**A6:** I'll inform Anand. The videos should still be available on the Tools in Data Science portal. They're from this section.

**Q7: Why are the videos and questions integrated into the GA itself?**

**A7:** Based on past data, students often go straight to the assignments without reviewing the content. Integrating the content into the GA is a better way to ensure they see it.

**Q8: I'm struggling with the project. The concepts are confusing. Could you present a model project and explain things step-by-step?**

**A8:** Yes, we'll do that in future sessions. We'll work through a working prototype of the project to illustrate each step. The project only uses material from the first three weeks of the course. If you're thorough with that material, you should be able to complete the project. It seems there's a knowledge gap, but I have full faith you can handle it. We'll address that gap in future sessions, starting with the basics.

**Q9: I'm having trouble with Git and GitHub. Is there support available?**

**A9:** Yes, we'll provide as much support as possible. We'll also go through a working prototype in future sessions. If you're struggling with Git, you won't be able to do the project, as it's a prerequisite. We'll create a repository during a future session so you can see how it's done.

**Q10: What's required for grading?**

**A10:** Your repository must meet these criteria:

- It must exist and be publicly accessible.
- It must have a license file (MIT license).
- It must have a valid Dockerfile.
- The Docker image must be publicly accessible and run via the specified command.
- The Docker image must use the same Dockerfile as your GitHub repository.
