**A5:** I haven't used the code for solving that particular image compression question; I only used the provided website. I tried using the code, but it gave me an error about dimensions not matching the original file's dimensions. That's why I used the web application. There is a specific use case for this. Should we copy all the things like that and then change the parameters? For example, the path will be related to some website URL. It will be used in future classes. We probably won't spend much time on image compression, but it is important from a web perspective. In a particular video, they talked about how 50-51% of information on web pages is in image format, so reducing image size is important. From a project perspective, it won't be that relevant in future weeks.

**Q6: I tried to do Git commits from my CLI, but based on the given ID, a new repository was created. I want to use the one I created for GA1. How can I make sure that whatever changes I'm making get committed to the repository I signed up for?**

**A6:** Please share your screen. (The instructor then appears to have difficulty understanding the question.)

**Q7: I have a doubt in question 4. Actually, I've done the Vercel file for question 6 (What is the Vercel URL?). I'm uploading that URL, but it's not showing that it's up. Can I share my screen?**
