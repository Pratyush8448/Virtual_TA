**Q23: I have a question about prompt engineering. It mentions using the API a certain number of times. I haven't used it, but it generated a key. Can I proceed?**

**A23:** No, you don't need to use the API multiple times. The free OpenAI API access is only through the proxy. A normal OpenAI account is a subscription service and doesn't give you API access. You have to buy tokens to use the API.

**Q24: I've used a normal OpenAI account before. I was hoping to use those model IDs. Why can't I?**

**A24:** The free OpenAI account doesn't give you API access. You can only use their web-based service. To use the API, you have to buy tokens.

**Q25: Can you show me how to do that? Can I share my screen?**

**A25:** No need to share your screen. I'll show you how to access the API via the proxy. That's how your project will have to work.

**Q26: The ninth question in the prompt engineering section mentions paying money. Do I have to pay?**

**A26:** No, you don't have to pay.

**Q27: I have a few more questions. Will we have more sessions before GA3 is due?**

**A27:** Yes, we'll have at least three more sessions before GA3 is due.

**Q28: I thought GA3 was due this weekend. Is that wrong?**

**A28:** Yes, it's due this weekend, but we'll have three more sessions before then.

**Q29: I have another question. Is it okay to ask now?**

**A29:** Sure.

**Q30: I submitted my answers, but I don't know if I did it correctly. There's nothing to submit here. I just say "yes"?**

**A30:** You just say "yes" and submit to the URL. It will pick up the API itself.

**Q31: Why isn't it reflecting?**
