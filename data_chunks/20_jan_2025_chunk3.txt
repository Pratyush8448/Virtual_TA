**Q10: What if I encounter issues while trying to push changes to GitHub?**

**A10:** If you're using HTTPS, you'll need to use a personal access token instead of your password for authentication. If you encounter errors, ensure you have configured your Git username and email correctly using `git config`. You might also need to check the permissions granted to your personal access token or set up SSH keys for authentication.
