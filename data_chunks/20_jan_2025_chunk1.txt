**Q1: What is an ML project, and how does it compare to the "fitting of six models" project?**

**A1:** An ML (Machine Learning) project involves more factors than just fitting models. The "fitting of six models" project was a simplified version done for a friend's certification course. It involved training six models on a pre-cleaned dataset with some hyperparameter tuning but minimal data preprocessing or cleaning.

**Q2: Is the TDS project designed to provide a level playing field for everyone, considering some participants may lack coding experience?**

**A2:** The TDS project aims to combine everything learned in the course so far. It might seem challenging, especially for those without a coding background. The project requires creating an application with specific endpoints, pushing it to GitHub, creating a Docker file, and submitting it through a Google form. However, the course is designed to bridge the technical gap for non-technical participants, preparing them for industry standards. The instructors will provide support through dedicated sessions, and students are encouraged to use resources like ChatGPT and YouTube videos.

**Q3: What are the main components of the TDS project, and what tools are involved?**

**A3:** The TDS project has three main parts:

1. **GitHub:** For version control and code storage.
2. **Docker Hub:** For containerizing and deploying the application.
3. **LLM (Large Language Model):** For the core functionality of the application.
   The project involves using Fast API or similar frameworks to create the application, Podman to run the Docker image, and a form to submit the GitHub and Docker file details.

**Q4: How does the project accommodate participants from non-science or non-coding backgrounds?**
