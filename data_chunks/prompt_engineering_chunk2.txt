1. _To tie a shoelace, you cross the laces and pull them tight..._
  2. _To tie a necktie, you place it around the collar and loop it through..._

  _Now, apply a similar step-by-step style to describe how to tie a bow tie._ (Reason: Provides clear examples and a pattern to follow.)

> Give examples to the model. If you want someone to build a house, show them a sketch. Don’t just say ‘build something.’
> Giving examples is like showing a pattern. It makes everything easier to follow.

### Think step by step

Instruct the model to reason through the problem step by step. This leads to more logical, well-structured answers.

- **BAD**: _Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied?_ (Reason: No prompt for structured reasoning.)
- **GOOD**: _Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied? Think step by step._ (Reason: Directly instructs the model to break down reasoning into steps.)

> Ask the model to think step by step. Don’t ask the model to just give the final answer right away.
> That's like asking someone to answer with the first thing that pops into their head.
> Instead, ask them to break down their thought process into simple moves — like showing each rung of a ladder as they climb.
> For example, when thinking step by step, the model could, A, list each customer question, B, find out if it was addressed, and C, decide that the agent answered only 2 out of the 3 questions.

### Assign a role

Specify a role or persona for the model. This provides context and helps tailor the response style.
