**Q21: I used Docker Desktop, but I don't remember exactly what I did.**

**A21:** That's okay. Let's focus on the current assignment.

**Q22: What will be the description for the FastAPI part of the assignment?**

**A22:** The description will include the three lines of code you've already seen. These will be part of the request parameters.

**Q23: Why can't I just pass an ID instead of the whole string?**

**A23:** There might be other tasks that require different inputs.

**Q24: How are we restricting access to data from other servers?**

**A24:** We use the `Allow-Origin` header to specify which servers are allowed to access the data. The header contains information about where the request is coming from and the type of request (GET, POST, etc.). If you use `*`, any server can access it. Restricting access is a security measure.

**Q25: What is the trigger point for this assignment?**

**A25:** The trigger point is the same as before: a REST API POST call.

**Q26: For the fetch data from API and save it task, what is the URL?**

**A26:** It can be any URL. The assignment is about comparing your code, not fetching data from a specific URL.

**Q27: What is the purpose of the subprocess module?**

**A27:** The subprocess module allows you to execute commands from within your Python script. This is useful for executing code generated by the LLM.

**Q28: For task 3, what is the expected output?**

**A28:** The task can be described in different ways (e.g., English, Hindi). The LLM will generate the code to handle the task. You'll need to execute that code using the subprocess module.

**Q29: Is there a time frame for completing the project?**

**A29:** We'll prioritize project 1. We'll discuss the timeline for project 4 later.
