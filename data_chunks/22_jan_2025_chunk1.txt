**Q1: What are the essential base technologies to learn for the TDS course?**

**A1:** Focus on these three areas: 1) Bash and shell scripting; 2) Git; 3) CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Also, learn REST APIs. Other tools can be learned on the go once you have a basic understanding of these core technologies.

**Q2: Regarding the tools and techniques needed for the TDS course, are Bash and shell scripting, Git, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and REST APIs the only essential ones?**

**A2:** Yes, those are the core technologies. Other tools are supplementary and can be learned as needed throughout the course. The instructor suggests a three-part approach to learning: 1) Define the purpose; 2) Determine the technique; 3) Select the tools.

**Q3: In short, is it sufficient to learn the listed technologies to a certain depth, not necessarily to the level of a diploma?**

**A3:** Yes, learning to a certain depth is sufficient. The learning process should always be purpose-driven. You don't need to become an expert in any one tool; you need to know how to use it to accomplish your task.

**Q4: For the last two questions in Week 2 (the Llama file and the Docker file), do we need to install the applications or can we do it online?**

**A4:** For the Llama file, you don't need to download anything. For the Docker file, you can use online tools like Google Colab, which provides a Linux environment. You can run Docker directly in Colab.

**Q5: I deployed a project via GitHub, but I'm getting a 404 error. Why?**
