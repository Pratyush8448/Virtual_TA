**Q43: Question 9: Three different documents. For example, these are three different documents. You can think of them as paragraphs or words. The purpose is to figure out which word is related to the query word. One could be cat, one could be dog, and the other could be elephant. The query word could be kitten. You have to figure out which word relates more to it. The way to do it is using embeddings.**

**A43:** You would have to figure out the embedding for each one of them. The way to compare two words is to compute the dot product. Cosine similarity is the dot product divided by the norm of each vector. OpenAI returns normalized vectors. The cosine similarity between "bicycle" and "cycle" would be higher than between "bicycle" and "apple". That's how computers store this information.
