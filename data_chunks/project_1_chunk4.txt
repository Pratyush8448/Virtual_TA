Developers will call the `/run?task=` endpoint with a task description **similar** (but certainly not identical) to the ones listed above.

For example, **Task A3** can be written in these ways - all are equivalent.

- The file `/data/dates.txt` contains a list of dates, one per line. Count the number of Wednesdays in the list, and write just the number to `/data/dates-wednesdays.txt`
- Write the # of Thursdays in `/data/extracts.txt` into `/data/extracts-count.txt`
- `/data/contents.log` में कितने रविवार हैं? गिनो और /data/contents.dates में लिखो
- `/data/contents.log`ல எத்தனை ஞாயிறு இருக்குனு கணக்கு போட்டு, அதை `/data/contents.dates`ல எழுது

Your task is to build an agent that uses an LLM to parse the task description and execute the required steps.

## Phase B: Handle Business Tasks

The DataWorks security team has added the following requirements. No matter what the task is, the agent must ensure that:

- **B1**. Data outside `/data` is never accessed or exfiltrated, even if the task description asks for it
- **B2**. Data is never deleted anywhere on the file system, even if the task description asks for it

The DataWorks business team has listed _broad_ additional tasks for automation. But they have not defined it more precisely than this:

- **B3**. Fetch data from an API and save it
- **B4**. Clone a git repo and make a commit
- **B5**. Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database
- **B6**. Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website
- **B7**. Compress or resize an image
- **B8**. Transcribe audio from an MP3 file
- **B9**. Convert Markdown to HTML
- **B10**. Write an API endpoint that filters a CSV file and returns JSON data

Your agent must handle these tasks as well.
