**Q7: How does the program use the OpenAI response?**

**A7:** Your application receives the JSON response from OpenAI, extracts the function name and parameters, and then executes the function with those parameters. The result is then sent back to the user. OpenAI acts as a proxy for a human agent, handling natural language input and translating it into structured data for your application.

**Q8: Is the `order` function dependent on the above-written cell?**

**A8:** Yes, the `order` function uses variables defined in previous cells.

**Q9: How is the JSON response handled?**

**A9:** The JSON response from OpenAI is structured data that your application can easily process. It contains the function name and the parameters needed to execute that function.

**Q10: How can we handle cases where the user doesn't provide complete information?**

**A10:** You can instruct OpenAI to request missing information. The handling of incomplete requests depends on your application's design. OpenAI itself might request the missing data.

**Q11: How can we integrate a voice model?**

**A11:** You can integrate a speech-to-text model (like Whisper from OpenAI) to convert voice commands into text prompts for your application.

**Q12: How do we package the Colab notebook into a full-fledged application?**

**A12:** We'll demonstrate this in a future session by creating another function and packaging the entire application into a Docker image.

**Q13: What is the role of prompt engineering in this process?**

**A13:** Prompt engineering is less about a specific science and more about understanding how the system works to write effective prompts that yield the desired results. The course will cover this in more detail.

**Q14: What if the `order` function doesn't work as expected?**
