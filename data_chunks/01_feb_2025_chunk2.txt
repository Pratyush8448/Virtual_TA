**A4:** You send the user's natural language request (prompt) and a list of your application's capabilities to GPT. GPT determines which function to run and the required parameters, returning this information as structured JSON. Your application then uses this JSON to execute the appropriate function.

**Q5: What is the purpose of `if __name__ == "__main__":`?**

**A5:** This is the entry point for your application. The Python interpreter runs from top to bottom, but it won't run the code within this block unless the file is the starting file of the application. This is crucial for multi-file applications where the interpreter needs to know where to begin.

**Q6: Should I create a tunnel for this application?**

**A6:** No, there's no need to create a tunnel if you want others to try it. Using a tool like ngrok allows others to access your server directly and send queries. However, be aware that this might crash your system if the queries aren't clean, as there's no robust error handling.

**Q7: How do I pass URL-encoded parameters to a FastAPI application?**

**A7:** You pass them in the URL itself. For example, `localhost:8000/order?q=Laptop,2,123 Main St,2024-02-29`. The application then reads the parameter from the URL.

**Q8: Why is my application returning a null response or a 422 error?**

**A8:** Several things could cause this. Ensure that:

- The `prices` dictionary is defined globally, not within a function.
- The prompt is correctly formatted and includes all necessary information (items, address, time).
- The application can communicate with the outside world (check network connectivity).
- You are using the correct key in the JSON response (`.keys()`).

**Q9: How do I use Docker?**
