## Background

You are a clever student who has joined IIT Madras' Online Degree in Data Science. You have just enrolled in the [Tools in Data Science](https://tds.s-anand.net/) course.

To make your life easier, you have decided to build an LLM-based application that can automatically answer any of the graded assignment questions.

Specifically, you are building and deploying an API that accepts any question from one of these 5 graded assignments:

- [Graded Assignment 1](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga1)
- [Graded Assignment 2](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga2)
- [Graded Assignment 3](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga3)
- [Graded Assignment 4](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga4)
- [Graded Assignment 5](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga5)

... and responds with the answer to enter in the assignment.

## Create an API

Your application exposes an API endpoint. Let's assume that it is at `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/`.

The endpoint must accept a POST request, e.g. `POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/` with the question as well as optional file attachments as multipart/form-data.

For example, here's how anyone can make a request:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "question=Download and unzip file abcd.zip which has a single extract.csv file inside. What is the value in the "answer" column of the CSV file?" \
  -F "file=@abcd.zip"
```

The response must be a JSON object with a single text (string) field: `answer` that can be directly entered in the assignment. For example:

```json
{
  "answer": "1234567890"
}
```

## Deploy your application

Deploy your application to a public URL that can be accessed by anyone. You may use any platform, including Vercel.

(If you use ngrok, ensure that it is running continuously until you get your results.)
